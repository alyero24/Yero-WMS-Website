    <pre class="lyrictext">Yeah, ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
        More bookings and payments, that shit done got huge (shit done got huge)
        Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon (gone)
        Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool (yeah)
        Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube (lube)
        Good head on her shoulders like she still in school (uh)
        Pour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu
        Loyalty mandatory, you part of this crew (part of this crew)
        Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes (spending addiction)
        Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels (a hundred on jewels)
        Too many bitches, they coming in twos
        I took a Perc', I been itching since noon (itching since noon)
        Why the brokest the loudest in the room? (Loudest)
        Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool? (Want to be cool)
        Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool (nah)
        I'm out my depression, life been going smooth
        Bonds in my session, backend through the roof
        You gon' make some money, book me for a show
        Most of my classmates thought I was a joke
        Now look at their faces, I done gave 'em hope
        Blue Phantom, I'm like, "I need me one of those"
        I built my name up to help the business grow
        She freaky, pulled up without no pantyhose
        I'm stacking these benjamins, try not to boast
        Bought some exclusive drip on Melrose
        Fuck the judge, gave my cousin elbow
        Locked him up, put him in a hellhole
        They hope that he rotting out in mildew
        Ain't seen him since my first year of high school
        I'ma pay his way out for 'bout a mill' or two
        Ten years riding, I made sure he had some food
        I held that shit down, now look what we can do
        Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
        More bookings and payments that shit done got huge (shit done got huge)
        Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon (gone)
        Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool (yeah)

        Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool (nah)
        I'm out my depression, life been going smooth (yeah)
        Crew full of winners, no way we can lose
        I learned from mistakes, won't take another loss
        Vibes in the Sprinter, headed to the mall
        I rock flawless diamonds, please accept my flaws
        I'm getting that money, money over all
        If broke is your problem, cash is gonna solve it
        If she sell pussy, better have some bond nigga
        Hit you up high, you leaping like a frog (frog)
        Making these hits, I'm feeling like a batter
        Bought myself a ladder, I'ma stack it tall (tall)
        Gunna don't pay attention to these blogs
        They saying shit, I let this money talk (oh, yeah)
        Diamonds on me look like some glass shattered
        My bitch's ass fatter, keep a nigga hard (oh, yeah)
        Cars got some custom seats, they can massage
        Convertible coming at the end of March
        Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
        More bookings and payments that shit done got huge (shit done got huge)
        Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon (gone)
